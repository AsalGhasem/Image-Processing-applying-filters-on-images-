# Image-Processing-applying-filters-on-images-
In this project, I went through the mathematical backbone of applying filters on an image. Most of these are available in libraries. However, it was fun to explore the actual mathematical process of applying a filter (kernel) on an image! There are different parts and kernels. The comments and titles will help you on following the project!
